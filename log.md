# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've solved a problem on LeetCode.

**Thoughts** I've written many of codes for nearly 10 years, but I don't have systematic knowledge of algorithm. I'm going to learn it from now on! Today I've solved "Reverse String" in Rustlang. In the meanwhile, I found swap method for vector. It's very functional, because Rustlang doesn't permit take more than a mutable reference for an element of a vector.  In normal, an element should be cloned and be swapped with a temporary variable, but this way takes extra memory.
